# inuit-fractal-scaffold

This project combines [Fractal](http://fractal.build/), a living styleguide tool with [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss), a Sass framework based on the ITCSS methodology.

## Requirements

* Nodejs v4.4.7+
* Sass v3.3+
* Install the Fractal CLI tool via `npm install -g @frctl/fractal`

## Getting Started

Clone or download this repository, cd into the root directory and run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

You can then start to develop running:

```bash
$ npm start
```

and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.


## Optional

You can use our [atomic methodology repository](https://github.com/zookee1/atomic-design-fractal-scaffold) instead of starting with a clean project.

```bash
$ npm run starterkit
```

This will replace the src-folder with some examples and code guidelines which you can adapt.
